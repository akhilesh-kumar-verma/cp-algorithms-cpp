SHORTEST K-LENGTH-PATH
======================

EXPLANATION
-----------
This is same as counting number of ways instead of matrix multiplication the
goal is to find smallest way through any node so that it gives smaller route.

IMPLEMENTATION
--------------
Initially, the matrix is filled with maximum possible values. If any of path
has one edge equal to this max value we skip that path as it is not possible
to get better path but has a risk of overflow. In all other cases the
innermost loop takes care of the minimum finding procedure.
