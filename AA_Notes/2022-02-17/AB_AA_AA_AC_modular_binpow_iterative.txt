MODULAR BINARY EXPONENTIATION
=============================

EXPLANATION
-----------
This utilized the property of modulus that it can be distributed over product
so the results of every multiplication are stored/ used after performing the
modulus operation.

IMPLEMENTATION
--------------
For safe running of program the mod is desired to be lesser than or equal to
the max number the structure can hold. In our case long long and square root
is long.
